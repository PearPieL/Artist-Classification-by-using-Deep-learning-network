This project is aiming to attach art filters to an image as input photo or artwork base on generative adversarial network (GAN). Making model able to analysis the feature of
image by using convolutional neural network (CNN), detecting the edge of image and turning it to a line sketch, and helping user coloring it by chosen art filter base on style2paints.

I have used MATLAB2020A doing artist classification, and most of the code is automatically generated by Deep Network Designer function in MATLAB. The pretrained deep network models are also install by Deep Network Designer.
