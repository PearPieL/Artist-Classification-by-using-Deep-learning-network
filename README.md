Abstractâ€” This project is aiming to attach art filters to an
image as input photo or artwork base on generative adversarial
network (GAN). Making model able to analysis the feature of
image by using convolutional neural network (CNN), detecting
the edge of image and turning it to a line sketch, and helping
user coloring it by chosen art filter base on style2paints[1].
